I built this Resume Uploader Application by integrating the Front End UI built in React JS and the backend api built in Django Rest Framework(DRF). I used the React JS front end UI from the Geeky Shows' repository. The link is given below:

And, I built the Django Backend API and integrated with React JS by myself. I have also included the Postman API Endpoints export in this same repository.

Run both the Django server and React JS app then, the Resume Uploader App will be live.
